## Course Overview
This course will provide students with a thorough background in the newly emerging field of social cognitive neuroscience. A broad range of social phenomena will be examined at multiple levels. First, at the social level including experience and behaviors. Second, at the cognitive level which deals with information processing systems. And lastly, at the neural level which deals with brain/neuronal bases of the first two levels. Topics include joint action, animal and human communication, and altered social functioning in neurological and psychiatric disorders. These topics will be discussed at both general and specific (article) levels.

## Course Learning Goals
-	Gain insight into how humans became such big-brained, other-regarding apes
-	Gain insight into how human brains developmentally construct and pathologically lose an understanding of mind
-	Gain insight into how human brains achieve mutual understanding and how this elusive capacity underpins social interaction, culture, and society
-	Get a thorough background in neuroscientific approaches for advancing our understanding of human social phenomena  
-	Learn how to critically read the neuroscientific literature and view opposing theories and data in perspective
